Enhance the image comparison feature. Allow users to toggle between the original and edited image more smoothly, perhaps with a slider or a dedicated compare view. Ensure it works well with the undo/redo history.

Excellent request. You're thinking like a product owner, looking beyond the current implementation to envision a truly top-tier user experience. The "Compare" feature is a great place to start, as it's fundamental to any editing workflow. Let's expand on that and blueprint a 10X evolution for the entire Prompt-a-Pix application.

Here is a detailed proposal outlining improvements, new features, and UI/UX enhancements, with clear instructions for an AI coding assistant to implement them.

1. Core Feature Enhancements (The 10X Ideas)
These features will transform the app from a simple editor into a powerful, non-destructive creative suite.

Suggestion 1: AI-Powered "History Brush"
Concept: Instead of a binary undo/redo, this tool allows users to selectively "paint" back areas from a previous state in their history. For example, if they applied a filter that made the sky look great but ruined the skin tones, they could use the History Brush to paint the original skin back onto the filtered image.
Work Needed:
Create a new "History Brush" tool in the UI.
Implement a canvas-based brush interaction that records the user's strokes as a mask.
When the user paints, use the generated mask to composite the selected history state's pixels onto the current canvas state.
Suggestion 2: Layer-Based Editing with AI Masks
Concept: Introduce a familiar layer system, like in Photoshop. Every generative action (Retouch, Filter, Adjustment) creates a new layer on top of the base image. Critically, each layer would come with an AI-generated mask corresponding to the edited area. This makes all edits non-destructive and gives users fine-grained control to tweak the intensity or area of an effect after it has been applied.
Work Needed:
Refactor the state management from a linear history array to a layers array of objects.
Each layer object should contain the image data and a mask (initially null for full-image effects).
The Gemini API call for localized edits should be updated to also request a black-and-white mask of the changed area.
Implement a layer panel UI to show, hide, and select layers.
Suggestion 3: "Inspiration Gallery" & One-Click Style Transfer
Concept: Add a new "Gallery" tab that showcases stunning creations from the community. Each entry displays the final image, the prompt used, and the obfuscation techniques applied. A "Use this Style" button would then apply the same prompt and filter settings to the user's currently loaded image.
Work Needed:
Create a new "Gallery" component that fetches and displays a predefined list of inspirational examples (image, prompt, etc.).
Implement the "Use this Style" button functionality, which populates the prompt state and switches the user to the appropriate tab (filters or retouch) to execute the edit.
2. UI/UX & Layout Overhaul
Let's refine the core user flow to feel more professional and efficient.

Suggestion 1: Dynamic Sidebar Layout
Concept: Relocate the tool tabs from their current position into a collapsible vertical sidebar on the left. The main content area would be dedicated to the image. This is a more standard layout for professional editing tools and provides more screen real estate for both the image and the tool options.
Work Needed:
Create a new Sidebar component to house the tool selection icons (Retouch, Magic Fill, etc.).
Refactor App.tsx to use a two-column layout (Sidebar, Main Content).
The panel for the active tool (FilterPanel, CropPanel, etc.) should appear inside or next to the sidebar, not below the image.
Suggestion 2: Interactive History Timeline
Concept: Replace the simple Undo/Redo buttons with a more powerful and intuitive visual timeline. This would be a horizontal strip of thumbnails at the bottom of the screen, each representing a step in the edit history. Users can see their progression at a glance and click any thumbnail to instantly revert to that state.
Work Needed:
Create a HistoryTimeline component that maps over the history array.
For each history item, generate and display a small thumbnail.
Clicking a thumbnail should update the historyIndex to that item's index.
Suggestion 3: Command Palette (Power User Feature)
Concept: Implement a searchable command palette (like in VS Code or Figma) triggered by Ctrl/Cmd + K. This allows users to type and search for any action in the app (e.g., "Apply Synthwave", "Crop 16:9", "Download PNG", "Undo") without clicking through menus.
Work Needed:
Create a CommandPalette modal component that is hidden by default.
Add a global keyboard listener to toggle the palette's visibility.
Populate the palette with a list of all available actions and implement a fuzzy search input to filter them.
3. Enhanced Image Comparison Feature
This directly addresses your core request with industry-standard solutions.

Suggestion 1: "Split-View" Comparison Slider
Concept: This is the most popular and satisfying comparison method. A vertical handle is overlaid on the image, which the user can click and drag. To the left of the handle is the "before" image, and to the right is the "after." It provides a dynamic and granular way to inspect changes.
Work Needed:
Find or build a React component for image comparison sliders (e.g., react-compare-slider).
Integrate this component into the main image display area.
The "before" image prop will be history[historyIndex - 1] and the "after" image prop will be currentImage. It should only be active when canUndo is true.
Suggestion 2: Side-by-Side (Synchronized Pan/Zoom)
Concept: A dedicated "Compare Mode" that displays the "before" and "after" images next to each other. When the user zooms in or pans on one image, the other image's viewport updates in perfect sync, allowing for a detailed comparison of specific areas at high magnification.
Work Needed:
Create a new CompareView component that shows two image containers.
Implement pan and zoom logic (e.g., using a library like react-zoom-pan-pinch).
Synchronize the state (zoom level, position) between the two image instances.
Suggestion 3: "Flicker" & History Compare
Concept: The current "Compare" button (press-and-hold) is good, but it only compares against the original image. It should be enhanced to compare the current state with the previous state in history. This is far more useful for judging the effect of the most recent change.
Work Needed:
Update the logic for the "Compare" button (isComparing state).
Instead of always showing originalImage, the underlying image should be history[historyIndex - 1].
The isComparing logic should toggle the opacity of the currentImage to reveal the previous one underneath.
These enhancements will dramatically improve the application's usability, power, and professional feel. Let me know which of these you'd like to prioritize, and I can start generating the necessary code.
